Module 6 Homework Assignment
The following two files WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb respect the main work of this homework assignment challenge

The code in the file WeatherPy.ipynb outlines how the changes in weather (temperature, wind speed, humidity and cloudiness)
relates (or doesn't) to the latitude location of over 500 cities globally as those cities are closer to or further from the equator. 
4 scatter plot charts are created in the file to illustrate the relationships between:
  a. Latitude vs Temperature
  b. Latitude vs Humidity
  c. Latitude vs Cloudiness
  d. Latitude vs Wind Speed
The latter portion of this file shows the same scatter plots along with linear regression lines and r-scores (correlation coefficients) to
show whether there are strong relationships or not between the four groups a - d above.
The file cities.csv is the data used to generate the original list of cities.

The attached 4 files Fig1.png, Fig2.png, Fig3.png,and Fig4.png, are copies of those scatter plot charts.

The second file VacationPy.ipynb involves narrowing the original list of cities to 43 cities based on introducing
ideal weather conditions (maximum temperatures, wind speed and cloudiness) and displaying them on a map.

Last the file includes a 2nd map created by linking the 43 city coordinates to Geoapify API to identify the existence of the nearest
hotel or other accommodations within 10,000 meters.
